    "review": "This film had a great soundtrack, story, and presentation, If you enjoy black and white films, and speak Persian, or are okay with subtitles you will probably really enjoy this film as well. It also stars a cat, (which of course is not hurt during the film), and I think really ties the film together. While this is kind of a vapmire movie, it also isn’t, I’m not a fan of vampire films, its about as much a vampire film as Let the Right One In, if you enjoyed Let the Right One In (the original) you will enjoy this.",

The film requires two separate lengthy monologues to explain the backstory and supernatural elements of “Willys”. Nick Cage makes this film fun. If you enjoy Nick Cage, and/or Killer Klowns From Outer Space, you will have fun with this one.",

Whileit was much longer than It needed to be, I wouldnt say it was bad. If you enjoy Twilight Zone you will enjoy this film.",

Its a good movie, with a resolved ending. About three quarters of the way through it no longer feels like a horror film, but if you are okay with exiting genres, and enjoy Twilight Zone you will probably enjoy this one",

    "review": "After watching the trailer and reading about this film, I had to see it. The opening card states the film was cut down from 25 hours of “found footage” I think they could have cut it down even more and told the same story with greater effect. Other than it being too long, its uniqueness and oddness make it intriguing, and three is something really satisfying about the ending, the characters were able to really change the tone in a way that gave the viewer some ease after a lot of discomfort. If you like movies that are different, enjoy found footage horror, or sit through hour long unedited youtube videos, you will probably have the stamina to get through the 1hr 30min of this film. Also wihle no animals are harmed in this film, there is a shot of a dead cat lying by the side of the road, that they stop to film a moment, I saw it in the trailer so I knew to cover my eyes during this part.",

If you are looking to jupm into the series, this is one I’d recommend, though it might help to watch the first one first as Nancy returns, though not necessary. Like all Nightmare on Elm Streets, there is a good bit of gore/violence in this one, though not as much as some of the others, and unlike the others in not the focus of the film. It has a full story with depth that make this a solid film.",
